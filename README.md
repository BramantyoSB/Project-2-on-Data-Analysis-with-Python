Project II: Tutorial to do analysis on World CO2 Data
Drawing upon our knowledge in Python and its data science libraries—Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib—__we can leverage our expertise in addressing pressing global challenges__. This case study specifically delves into __examining the historical extent of climate change__. 
__Understanding Climate Change__

People often ask, _Why is CO2 emissions a prime indicator of climate change? Why not other metrics?_ 

The [United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/greenhouse-gases) addresses this by highlighting that CO2 emissions presently constitute the largest share of the warming linked to human activities. This allows us to draw parallels between CO2 emissions and its climate effects. 

Resources used:
We will be looking at the dataset provide by the World Bank: [CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?downloadformat=csv).

The specific .csv file in the zip file downloaded is titled "API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_5995557". The file name will be manually changed into "World CO2 Data" for better naming convention.
